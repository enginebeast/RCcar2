### Choosing appropriate motors for the project and puchasing them

### Controlling motors with an arduino

### Building a driving system  
- Level of arduino
- DC motor
- Motor driver
- Multiple gears

### Building a steering system  
- Level of arduino
- Servo motor or DC motor
- Making frame using a foam board

### Recognizing the objects
- Camera, RADER, and LIDER
- Level of Raspberry pi

### Cirtuit for Checking battery status and deciding whether to charge or continue working

### Frame
- If we want, we make it using a 3D printer. But, it can be substituted with foamboard and has low priority.
