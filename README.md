### Choosing appropriate motors for the project and puchasing them

### Controlling a servo motor using serial communication with Arduino

### Controlling a DC motor using serial communication with Arduino
- Motor driver

### Controlling servo motor and DC motor with an arduino

### Building a driving system  
- Multiple gears
- Making frame using a foam board  

### Building a steering system  
- Servo motor or DC motor
- Making frame using a foam board

### Recognizing the objects
- Camera, RADER, and LIDER
- Level of Raspberry pi

### Cirtuit for Checking battery status and deciding whether to charge or continue working

### Frame
- If we want, we make it using a 3D printer. But, it can be substituted with foamboard and has low priority.
